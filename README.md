# trumpGameGh


A front-end game that puts the user at the center of the Trump Administration.


The user plays as a White House official who has one job: keep Trump off Twitter.


Unfortunately, that is easier said than done, as every improperly managed crisis leaves Trump one step closer to blowing his fuse and venting his feelings. Tread lightly!



Live GH page of the game can be found here.
